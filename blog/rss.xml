now in GitLab, Gitea and GitHub.</p><p>Webhooks allows for triggering a flow in a branch. The webhook may
come now from 3 Git hosting services: GitLab, Gitea and GitHub.  There
are two kinds of webhook events supported: push and pull request (in
the case of GitHub and Gitea) and merge request (in the case of
GitLab). A push even to a given branch causes a CI flow to be
started. If this is a pull request or a merge request, then a DEV flow
is started. If a workflow schema checks out sources from this
repository, a version indicated in the push or the pull/merge request is
checked out.</p><p>The <a href="/docs/guide-webhooks">Webhook Guide</a> shows how to configure
webhooks in a project, and then how to configure a Git hosting
service. In the end, checking out the repository in the workflow
schema is presented.</p>]]></content:encoded>

The most noteworthy changes are:</p><ul><li>improved diagnostics capabilities, i.e. browsing internal logs from Kraken services</li><li>integration with AWS EC2 - this is in beta state</li></ul><p><a href="/docs/quick-start">Quick Start</a> guide shows how to install Kraken CI.</p><h2>The list of changes</h2><p>The complete list of changes looks as follows.</p><p>Features &amp; improvements:</p><ul><li>#105 added browsing Kraken logs in diagnostics page</li><li>added errors number indicator in the top menu bar</li><li>added integration with AWS EC2 - spawning VMs for jobs (beta/preview)</li><li>added loading status with a spinner to submit, refresh and other buttons</li><li>added interpolating variables in system and agents_group names in a workflow schema</li><li>added adding kraken user to docker group and configuring sudo in agent installer</li><li>kraken workflow: switched to AWS agents in build and static analysis jobs</li><li>added codebeat badge to readme</li></ul><p>Fixes:</p><ul><li>fixed preparing repo changes data</li><li>fixed counting agents in agents group</li><li>fixed updating schema_from_repo_enabled</li><li>fixed colors of top menu items</li></ul><h2>Improved diagnostics</h2><h3>Logs</h3><p>The diagnostics page accessible from the top menu bar got a
new feature: browser of Kraken services logs. The second tab on the
diagnostics page, called <code>Logs</code>, now contains filters and a
logs window.</p><div img="screen-diagnostics-logs.png"></div><p>The list of select buttons at the top allows selecting Kraken services
like server/api, celery or watchdog. Below, there is a dropbox with
log level selection, from info level to error level. When the celery
service is selected, selecting task type from the dropbox list is also
possible.</p><h3>Error Indicator</h3><p>To make it easier to reach logs with some problems, there have been
added an error indicator in the top menu bar.</p><div img="screen-error-indicator.png"></div><p>It is visible on all Kraken pages. If it is greater than 0, it is
displayed in reddish color to get user attention. The count indicates
the number of errors in Kraken services logs in the last hour.
When clicked, it leads to the logs page.</p><h2>Preliminary AWS EC2 integration</h2><p>The second, quite exciting feature, is integration with AWS EC2. The
integration allows for autoscaling Kraken&#x27;s agents. If no jobs are
waiting for execution, then there are no waitng agents on EC2
VMs. When they appear, new VMs in EC2 are spawned immediately. If the
number of jobs grows, the number of VMs can grow as well. There is
possible to set a limit for the number of VMs. VMs can be reused or
reclaimed after a given period of idle time or after an indicated
number of executed jobs.</p><p>The configuration in Kraken for AWS EC2 integration is 1) in global
settings (credentials) and 2) on the agent&#x27;s group page.</p><p>More details will be presented when the feature is completed.</p>]]></content:encoded>
