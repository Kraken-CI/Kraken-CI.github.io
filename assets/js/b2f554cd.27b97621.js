Now it is possible to\\njust generate such measurements, store them in a JSON file and then\\nload them to the Kraken server. Then they will be visible on a job\\nresults page and it is possible to display a chart based on these\\nvalues.\\n\\nThe reported file should look like this (e.g. metrics.json):\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\"metric-1\\": 432,\\n    \\"metric-2\\": 2.12,\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe step that consumes these values should look like this:\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n    \\"tool\\": \\"values_collect\\",\\n    \\"files\\": [{\\n        \\"name\\": \\"metrics.json\\",\\n        \\"namespace\\": \\"metrics\\"\\n    }, {\\n        \\"name\\": \\"params.json\\",\\n        \\"namespace\\": \\"params\\"\\n    }],\\n    \\"cwd\\": \\"example\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe end results looks like that:\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-values-chart.png\\" />\\n\\n\\nThe whole example of workflow with collected results is present in\\nKraken lab: https://lab.kraken.ci/branches/32/ci.

Now, after 10 days, these files are deleted from\\nMinIO.\\n\\n\\n### Changes in Base Images\\n\\nThe Go lang base image has been updated. The latest image contains Go\\nin 1.18.  The location of the image is:\\n[krakenci/golang:1.18](https://hub.docker.com/r/krakenci/golang).\\n\\nThere is also a new image with [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/).

One of them is a `Results Charts`\\ntab.  On this tab, a results history chart can be found.  It presents\\na pass ratio line in % units and two more lines: passed and total that\\nshows the number of passed tests and the total number of tests over time.\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-flow-pass-ratio-history.png\\" />\\n\\n\\n### Pass Ratio Stats of Flow\\n\\nOn the other tab, `Results Stats`, a table shows tests passing\\nstats. The dimensions of the table are dynamic. They can be selected\\nfrom dropdowns available over the table. There can be chosen:\\n`Stage`, `Agents Group` and `System`.\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-flow-pass-ratio-stats.png\\" />\\n\\n\\n### Secrets Masking\\n\\nAnother feature is related to security. Quite often, a password or\\nsome access key needs to be passed during build or test\\nexecution. Sometimes this secret is revealed in logs. Now Kraken knows\\nsecrets defined in a project and it masks them in the logs. The\\nsecrets are caught quite early and they do not leave a machine that\\ntraced them to logs. The log database stores only masked passwords.\\n\\nThere is one interesting property of this masking that cannot be found\\nin other CI systems: it can mask multiline secrets like SSH private\\nkey.\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-logs-masked-secrets.png\\" />\\n\\n\\n### Log Panel Improvements\\n\\nThere were added several improvements to the log panel:\\n\\n- coloring ANSI color codes in HTML log box\\n- turning timestamps on/off\\n- showing missing timestamps\\n- log loading indicator\\n\\nThe screens below show colored logs and timestamps that are either\\nswitched off or switched on.\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-log-box-timestamps-off.png\\" />\\n\\n<Screen img=\\"screen-log-box-timestamps-on.png\\" />\\n\\n\\n### Flow Navigation Improved\\n\\nThe last feature presented here is flows navigation.
