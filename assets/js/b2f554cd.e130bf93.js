The\\nintegration allows for autoscaling Kraken\'s agents. If no jobs are\\nwaiting for execution, then there are no waitng agents on EC2\\nVMs. When they appear, new VMs in EC2 are spawned immediately. If the\\nnumber of jobs grows, the number of VMs can grow as well. There is\\npossible to set a limit for the number of VMs. VMs can be reused or\\nreclaimed after a given period of idle time or after an indicated\\nnumber of executed jobs.\\n\\nThe configuration in Kraken for AWS EC2 integration is 1) in global\\nsettings (credentials) and 2) on the agent\'s group page.\\n\\nMore details will be presented when the feature is completed."},{"id":"kraken-release-0-492","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kraken-release-0-492","editUrl":"https://github.com/kraken-ci/website/edit/master/blog/blog/2021-04-24-kraken-release-0-492.mdx","source":"@site/blog/2021-04-24-kraken-release-0-492.mdx","title":"Kraken Release 0.492","description":"The 0.492 release contains one feature:","date":"2021-04-24T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"April 24, 2021","tags":[{"label":"kraken","permalink":"/blog/tags/kraken"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.545,"truncated":true,"authors":[{"name":"Michal Nowikowski","title":"Kraken Founder.
